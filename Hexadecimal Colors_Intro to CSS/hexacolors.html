Cascading Style Sheets
Each div is its on line while multiple spans can be on the same line. Used to imply logical grouping of elements
Gradients allow you to display smooth transitions between colors
Inheritance is a mechanism seperate from the cascade and applies to the document object model tree
Inline style is applied directly to the html element, embedded styles are placed within the head element of an html document, and external styles are placed in a css document which is then referenced by the html document
Ids are used to select a single unique element
Css classes are used to define a special state of an element
Margins define the space around the element while padding defines the space inside the element
All monospace characters have the same width ex. LUCIDA CONSOLE
