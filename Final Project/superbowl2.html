<p>The 2012 season for the Baltimore Ravens was a very special one. The Ravens head coach was John Harbaugh. The Ravens finished first in the AFC North with a 10-6-0 record. The Ravens offense had just as much impact as the Ravens defense in winning the Super Bowl. The Ravens won their second Super Bowl, thanks to a defense headlined by <a href="lewisray.html">Ray Lewis</a> who many thought would not play after an injury to his triceps, and thanks to an offense headlined by Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco.</p>
