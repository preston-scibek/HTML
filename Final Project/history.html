<div id="header"><h1>A History of the Baltimore Ravens</h1></div>
<div id="menuBar"></div>
<p> The Baltimore Ravens were established in 1996. The city of Baltimore was without a team since the Baltimore Colts left town with all the records and history in 1984. In 1996, Cleveland Browns owner, Art Modell, moved the Browns to Baltimore. Unlike the Colts, Modell kept the Browns history and records in Cleveland. The first two seasons were played at Memorial Stadium, with the team relocating to M&amp;T Bank Stadium in its third season. The following is a table of the Ravens season records, playoff records, and highlights of each season (if applicable).</p>
