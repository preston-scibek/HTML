<p>The 2000 season for the Baltimore Ravens was a very special one. The Ravens head coach was Brian Billick. The Ravens finished second in the AFC Central with a 12-4-0 record. The defense of the 2000 season is considered the greatest defense of all time. The Ravens won their first Super Bowl, thanks to a defense headlined by <a href="lewisray.html">Ray Lewis</a> who many thought would not play after a controversial offseason. The defense did not allowed a score all game during the Super Bowl. The only score for the New York Giants came on a kickoff return.</p>
